# Playback-UWP
UWP Desktop App to record game/desktop video and audio. Along with clipping and video editing features for easy upload to Youtube and other sites.

### **Archiving this repo because I am rewriting the entirety of Playback in WPF!**
There are too many limitations with UWP Desktop Apps. I like the idea that I could write code once and have it deployed to many different platforms, but that also limited the capabilites
of what my app could do. See ya next time UWP!
